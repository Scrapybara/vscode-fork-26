# Demo background tweak

This branch forces the default workbench background to green for a visual demonstration.

Files touched:
- src/vs/workbench/browser/media/style.css (appended overrides)
- CAPY-DEMO.txt (marker)

This file exists to make the demo more traceable.

## Updates
- Removed redundant html override
- Added minor .part tint and kept lists readable
